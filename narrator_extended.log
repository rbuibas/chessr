This file deals with steps taken for further implementation and design.
The Chess application has been made ased on the Utku's video, however a lot of things aren't included in that series, like:
- when does the game end
- special cases (pawn promotion, en passent)
- deployment
- versioning

# Deployment

Following things need to be take re-checked when deployting:
- build.properties needs to be checked (resource folders where icons are needs to be added to the plugin pack)
