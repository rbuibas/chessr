Based on Utku Ufuk's video serioes on Youtube:

...only started writing this from the 5th lessons, so maybe do a retroactive naration later.

# Lesson 5

We need to build an "Army" so we can keep track of the pieces for each side (Black/White).
It should hold two lists:
	1. Live pieces
	2. Dead pieces
Wonder if we need separate black and white army ?

# Lesson 6 - Create the Feature Plug-In

This video handles linking of the two plugins together.
One holds the engine and the other holds the actual app (UI).

Core needs not be aware of anything outside of itself, so it will be one way dependency.

First, cereate a new feature project, in which the included plugins need to be added.
Those are the two we created.
Then, in UI plugin in the Content tab of the product the feature needs to be added.
Also following features need to be added as well:
<feature id="org.eclipse.e4.rcp" version="1.6.300.v20181204-1801"/>
<feature id="org.eclipse.emf.ecore" version="2.16.0.v20181124-0637"/>
<feature id="org.eclipse.emf.common" version="2.15.0.v20180914-1817"/>

Remove the versions, so there won't be any compatibility issues.

Further, for the functionality we need to add the ChessRoom, where the game will be managed.
From the ChessBoardPart the ChessRoom will be referenced, because we do not want to 
overcrowd the ChessBoardPart, which should only handle the visual part.
